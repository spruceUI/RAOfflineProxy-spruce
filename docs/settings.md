# Settings & Auto-start (Android)

## Settings Screen

Navigate to **Settings** in the drawer to access the following options.

### Auto-start on Boot

**Autostart RAOfflineProxy at startup**: when enabled, the proxy service starts automatically when the device boots.

::: warning Both conditions must be met
Auto-start only works when **both** of the following are true:
1. The "Autostart" checkbox is checked
2. At least one enabled emulator config can be patched successfully on boot

If the needed emulator config cannot be patched (e.g. folder access was never granted and the file is not directly writable), the service will not start on boot.

### Clear Cache

Removes all cached game data from the local database - game data, ROM identifiers, unlock lists, and session data.

Your login credentials are **preserved** - clearing the cache does not log you out.

::: tip When to clear cache
Use **Clear Cache** if your cached game data is stale or if you want to free up storage. You will need to re-cache your games before playing offline.
:::

### Clear Database

Removes **all** data from the database: including cached game data **and all pending awards**.

::: danger This deletes pending awards
If you have unsynced offline unlocks in the Pending Awards queue, **Clear Database will permanently delete them**. Make sure you are online and all awards have been sent before using this option.

## Proxy Toggle (Action Bar)

The action bar at the top of every screen has a **Start proxy / Stop proxy** button.

| State | Button label | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy stopped | Start proxy | Start proxy |
| Proxy running, online | Stop proxy | Proxy running — online |
| Proxy running, offline | Stop proxy | Proxy running — offline |

Starting the proxy automatically patches the enabled supported emulator configs. Stopping it reverts those config changes and restores any previous hardcore mode setting. See [Emulator CFG Patching](./cfg-patching) for emulator-specific details.

## Persistent Notification

When the proxy is running, a persistent notification is shown:

- **Online**: "Online — Forwarding to RA"
- **Offline**: "Offline — Serving from cache"

Tapping the notification opens the app. The notification cannot be dismissed while the proxy is running.

## Background Refresh

While the proxy is running and the device is online, cached games you **played in the last 7 days** are automatically refreshed **every 60 minutes**. This keeps their achievement lists and unlock counts up to date without any manual action. The refresh waits until the proxy has been idle for 5 minutes, so it does not run while you are playing.

To refresh every cached game, for example before going offline, use the refresh icon on the **Cached Games** screen.

Cached games are never removed by the background refresh. Only temporary data older than **60 days** is cleaned up. Login credentials are exempt - you will not be logged out by this process.
